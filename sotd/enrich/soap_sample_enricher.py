    Extracts sample/smush information from patterns like:
    - "Summer Break Soaps - Steady (sample)" -> sample_type: "sample"
    - "Summer Break Soaps - Steady - soap (sample -- thanks!!)" -> sample_type: "sample"
    - "Summer Break Soaps - Steady (sample 3 of 10)" -> sample_type: "sample",
      sample_number: 3, total_samples: 10
    - "a smush from u/Someone" -> sample_type: "sample"
    - "Mystery Smush Croap" -> sample_type: "sample"

    Uses the normalization-difference approach to avoid confusion between product names
    and sample indicators by leveraging the already-done normalization work.
    Smush/samp collapse to sample_type "sample" (report copy says "samples or smushes").
